# Adding Hero Video to Your Portfolio

Your portfolio is designed to support a cinematic hero video background. Here's how to add one:

## Option 1: Create Your Own Video

### Using iPhone/Smartphone:
1. Record a 10-15 second video in landscape mode
2. Keep it simple - perhaps a slow pan of your workspace, city skyline, or abstract visuals
3. Ensure good lighting and steady footage
4. Export in MP4 format

### Video Specifications:
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec)
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) minimum
- **File Size**: Under 10MB for web performance
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)

## Option 2: Use Stock Video

### Recommended Sources:
- **Pexels Videos** (free): https://www.pexels.com/videos/
- **Unsplash Videos** (free): https://unsplash.com/videos
- **Pixabay Videos** (free): https://pixabay.com/videos/

### Search Terms:
- "business professional"
- "office workspace"
- "technology abstract"
- "data visualization"
- "modern office"
- "consulting meeting"

## Option 3: Convert Existing Photos to Video

You can create a subtle video effect from your existing photos:

### Using macOS Photos App:
1. Select 3-5 of your best photos
2. Create a slideshow with slow transitions
3. Export as video

### Using Online Tools:
- **Canva**: Create animated presentations
- **Adobe Express**: Photo to video conversion

## Adding the Video to Your Portfolio

1. **Save your video** as `hero-video.mp4` in the `images/` folder
2. **Test the file** by opening it - it should play smoothly
3. **Refresh your portfolio** - the video will automatically load

## Current Fallback

Right now, your portfolio uses your profile image as a poster/fallback. If no video is added, it will show a beautiful gradient background instead.

## Performance Tips

- **Compress your video** using tools like HandBrake or online compressors
- **Test on mobile** to ensure it loads quickly
- **Keep it under 10MB** for best performance
- **Mute the audio** (already handled in the code)

## Alternative: Remove Video Feature

If you prefer not to use video, you can easily switch back to a static hero by:
1. Editing `index.html`
2. Replacing the video section with an image or gradient background
3. The current design will gracefully fall back to a static background

Your portfolio looks amazing either way! ðŸŽ¬âœ¨
